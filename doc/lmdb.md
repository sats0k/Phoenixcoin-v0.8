# LMDB chain index backend

Phoenixcoin stores the block index and the transaction/UTXO index in the chain
database.  Berkeley DB (`blkindex.dat`) remains the default backend; LMDB can be
selected explicitly with `-dbbackend=lmdb`.

Wallet and address storage are not affected.  `wallet.dat` stays on Berkeley DB
and is not migrated.

## Enabling LMDB

1. Stop Phoenixcoin.
2. Back up the data directory.
3. Start with `-dbbackend=lmdb` (or put `dbbackend=lmdb` in
   `phoenixcoin.conf`).

On the first LMDB start Phoenixcoin copies every record from an existing
`blkindex.dat` into `<datadir>/blkindex/`.  The copy runs in a single LMDB
transaction, so an interrupted migration rolls back and is retried on the next
start.  `blkindex.dat` is left in place and is not modified.

After a successful migration Phoenixcoin writes `<datadir>/blkindex.backend`
containing `lmdb`.  This marker makes the data directory's backend explicit:

- starting without `-dbbackend=lmdb` fails with a clear error instead of
  silently loading the stale `blkindex.dat`;
- a datadir that already contains a non-empty `blkindex/data.mdb` but no marker
  (created by an older development build) is treated as an LMDB datadir for the
  same reason;
- a marker that says `lmdb` requires a non-empty LMDB index.  If `blkindex/` is
  missing, empty, or removed, startup fails rather than silently re-importing
  the migration-time `blkindex.dat` snapshot;
- migration from `blkindex.dat` only runs when no marker exists (or the marker
  is `bdb`).

## Returning to Berkeley DB

Back up the data directory, then remove both `<datadir>/blkindex` and
`<datadir>/blkindex.backend`.  Phoenixcoin will start with Berkeley DB again and
use the untouched `blkindex.dat`.  Any blocks imported while LMDB was active
must be re-downloaded or re-imported, because that work only exists in the LMDB
index.

## Options

- `-dbbackend=lmdb|bdb` — chain index backend, default `bdb`.
- `-lmdbmapsize=<MiB>` — maximum size of the LMDB chain index map.  The default
  is 4096 MiB on 64-bit platforms and 1024 MiB elsewhere.  The map size is a
  limit, not a preallocation.  The value must be a positive integer; values that
  are not representable or that exceed the platform's LMDB address-space limit
  are rejected at startup.  32-bit builds accept at most 2048 MiB, and the
  converted byte count must be a multiple of the system page size.
- `-lmdbnosync=<0|1>` — default `1`.  Commits do not fsync, matching Berkeley
  DB's `DB_TXN_WRITE_NOSYNC` behaviour and avoiding an fsync per block during
  initial sync.  Transactions remain atomic and consistent.  Set to `0` for
  per-commit durability.  A clean shutdown always flushes the environment.

## Map usage and growth

At startup Phoenixcoin prints how much of the LMDB map is in use:

```
LMDB chain index: 123.4 of 4096.0 MiB used
```

When the mapped file is already larger than the configured map size, the map is
enlarged automatically, so a datadir created with a larger `-lmdbmapsize` can be
started without repeating the option.  If the index reaches the map limit,
writes fail with an `LMDB map is full` message; stop the node and restart with a
larger `-lmdbmapsize`.

Online resizing while the node is running is not implemented.

## Write consistency

Adding a block writes its block-index record and, when it becomes the best
chain, the best-chain pointer in one transaction.  If any part of that write
fails, the transaction is aborted and the newly created in-memory
`mapBlockIndex` entry is removed again, so a failed write cannot leave an index
entry whose database record was rolled back.  This applies to both backends.

## Recovery

LMDB never overwrites committed pages in place, so an interrupted process leaves
the last committed transaction intact.  With `-lmdbnosync=1` a system crash or
power loss may lose the most recent commits, but the environment stays
consistent and is reconciled on the next start.

There is no `-reindex` mode in this codebase, and blocks are not replayed from
the `blk0001.dat` files.  If the index is lost, remove the chain index
(`blkindex/` and `blkindex.backend` for LMDB, or `blkindex.dat` for Berkeley DB)
and the node creates a fresh index containing only the genesis block, then
downloads the chain again.

If the marker says `lmdb` but the LMDB index is missing or empty, restore
`blkindex/` from a backup.  To deliberately fall back to the migration-time
snapshot, remove only `blkindex.backend`; the next LMDB start will then import
`blkindex.dat` again.  That snapshot does not contain blocks or UTXO changes
made after the original migration, so prefer a backup when one exists.

## Validation

The backend was validated on Linux x86-64 with a build configured with
`-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer` and LTO disabled.

- `kvdb_tests` passed 24/24 test cases (1238 assertions) with no sanitizer
  reports.
- `regression_lmdb_chain_migration.sh` passed 64/64 checks with
  AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer enabled.
- The full unit suite passed 140/141 test cases (40534/40535 assertions).
  The only failure was the timing-sensitive `DoS_tests/DoS_checkSig` under
  sanitizer slowdown.  There were no AddressSanitizer errors.  The eight
  UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer reports were all in pre-existing non-LMDB code
  (`Hash160` on an empty vector, base32/base64 decoding, and empty-vector
  handling in `EvalScript`).

Crash recovery was checked at two points:

- Killing the daemon part-way through migration left no backend marker.
  The next start discarded the partial index, repeated the migration, and
  produced the same 588001 records and chain tip as an uninterrupted
  migration.
- Three `SIGKILL`/restart cycles during initial sync at and above height
  202135 always reopened the last committed tip or a later one.  The tip
  block and its coinbase transaction remained readable after every restart,
  and syncing continued to height 227811 with 665129 records.

A full BDB chain at height 202135 (588001 records: 202136 `blockindex` and
385861 `tx`) was migrated in about three seconds.  LMDB contained exactly
588001 entries in a 72118272-byte `data.mdb`, and the BDB and LMDB tips had the
same hash.  The migrated node then continued syncing normally.
